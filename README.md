(HALF-ASSED RIGHTS MANAGEMENT THING [fix later])
Something something opensource, do what you want with it as long as it isn't for financial gain blah blah,
If you do use it, credit Tyler Hoskins as the creator.
(END OF HALF-ASSED RIGHTS MANAGEMENT THING [seriously, fix later])

Ultimate goal with this project is to build a working, reuseable linked list library.  Ideally, each function should be able
to take any struct as an argument and perform simple operations on it.

*****Functionality*****
Should be able to create a new node in the list.
Should be able to add newly ceated node to front or back of list.
Should be able to remove nodes from top and bottom of list (pop n drop!)
Should be able to loop through the entire list and return the bottom of the list
